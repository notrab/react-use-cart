# Contributing to `react-use-cart`

This library was built to be a thin layer between your product inventory + checkout.

Before you get started writing any code, make sure:

- You search open PRs and issues, someone else might be working on it
- Adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - this helps out our automated release bot
- Update the `README` with any added functionality usage instructions
- Add test coverage

## Working in development

This library uses [tsdx](https://tsdx.io). Execute `npm start` to start the project in development/watch mode.

The example directory uses the library with parcel, and you'll need to `cd example` and `npm install` to get going.

## PR early

The single most important thing you can do is PR early in `DRAFT` status. This allows maintainers, and other users to see what you're working on, and provide any suggestions early.
